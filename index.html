        <h1>Miles Scarboro</h1>
        <h2>Junior from Fayetteville, North Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a junior at Bob Jones University majoring in Biblical Counseling with a concentration in Youth Ministries. Lord willing, I plan to be a youth pastor after I graduate.</p>
         <p>
            One of my biggest passions is participating in ministry. While at BJU, I lead an outreach to local nursing home, act as chaplain for my society, and lead the choir at church. Perhaps my favorite ministry is my position as Youth Director at my local church. 
         </p> 
         <p>
            My interets/hobbies include acting, reading, and public speaking. I also have an unhealthy obsession with chickens. I mean, they are an animal you can eat and have as a pet! How amazing is that!
