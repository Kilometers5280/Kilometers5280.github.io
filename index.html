        <h1>Miles Scarboro</h1>
        <h2>Junior from Fayetteville, North Carolina</h2>
        
         <p>I am a junior at Bob Jones University, majoring in Biblical Counseling with a concentration in Youth Ministries. Lord willing, I plan to be a youth pastor after I graduate.</p>
         <p>
            One of my biggest passions is participating in ministry. While at BJU, I lead an outreach at a local nursing home, act as chaplain for my society, and lead the choir at church. Perhaps my favorite ministry is the position as Youth Director at my local church. 
         </p> 
         <p>
             My interests/hobbies include acting, reading, and public speaking. I also have an unhealthy obsession with chickens. I mean, they are an animal you can both eat and have as a pet! How amazing is that?!
